WElcome to that cord
here is how to use this thing

- both users need to be on the same network 
- there can only be 1 server side 
- run server.java on one pc 
- run client.java on another 
now u can talk to each other


if there is any error realted to the port then just change the port from the source code of both files 
the port must be same on both client.java and server.java.

on client.java its on the 7th line last 4 digits port.
on server.java its on the 14th line .


thanks for using gui version comming soon .
